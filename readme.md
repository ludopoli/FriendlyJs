FriendlyJs 0.0.1
============

## What's FriendlyJs?

Javascript clientside and nodejs library for making friendly URLs by stripping out non lating chars, as well as converting chars in different languages to their latin counterparts.

Using it in a browser is quite simple:

```javascript
friendly('like this') //=> "like-this"
friendly().url('or like that дада') //=> "or-like-that-dada"

// or something more interesing like that:
var boom = new friendly();
boom.alphabets //=> collection of alphabets and rules
boom.trimNonLatinChars('love!me') //=> 'love-me' 
boom.convertToLatin(str)  //=> converts non Latin chars using alphabets (cyrilic and german chars are supported by default). ex. 'Привет' -> 'Privet'
boom.url(str) /=>
boom.toString() /=> identical to url
```

## Installation

For Nodejs there two ways to install the thingy, [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org/) is one of them:

```bash
$ npm install friendlyjs
```
Git clone is another one:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ludopoli/friendlyjs.git
```

And then just let the node know about it:

```javascript
var friendly = require('friendlyjs') // npm
var friendly = require('./friendly.js') // manual install
```

If you want to use the thing in the browser, well, just reference the file,
this will create a 'friendly' variable in the global score.


## Adding additional alphabets
is as easy as:

```javascript
var boom = new friendly();
boom.alphabets.sibirian = "^-a,@-o,f-j";
boom.convertToLatin('love^me@') //=> 'loveameo' 
boom.url('lov e^me@') /=> 'lov-eameo'
```
